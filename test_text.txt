i have a volvo c30 since a while now it shakes depeding on how fast i am driving. once i found that the front right tire was completly empty. i drove some time without to notice that.
a machanic found a hole in the tire and repaird it(just the hole not the tire) also he replaced the bearing rod front right but nothing changed.
