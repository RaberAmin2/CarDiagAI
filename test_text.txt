 my car a Volvo C30 experiences strong vibrations while driving, regardless of speed. The intensity of the shaking increases with higher speeds and decreases slightly at lower speeds, but the issue persists at all times.

Previously, the front right tire was found to be completely flat once. In addition, the tie rod on the right side has been replaced recently. But the problem still exists.
